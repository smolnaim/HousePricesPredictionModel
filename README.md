# House Prices Prediction Model

## Overview
This project involves predicting house prices using a Random Forest Model. The model is built using variables that have a correlation of 0.6 or higher with the target variable, `SalePrice`. The project includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to select the most relevant features for training the model.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

### Setup
Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Clone the repository and open the notebook:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
jupyter notebook house-prices-prediction-model.ipynb
```

### Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the notebook file (house-prices-prediction-model.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis and train the model.
The notebook allows you to:

Load and process the house prices dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify relevant features.
Train a Random Forest model on the selected features.
Evaluate the model's performance.

### Project Structure
house-prices-prediction-model.ipynb: The main notebook containing the EDA and model training process.
data/: Directory containing the input datasets (if any).
output/: Directory for generated visualizations and model outputs.

### Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques." It includes train and test datasets that contain various features of houses along with their sale prices.
